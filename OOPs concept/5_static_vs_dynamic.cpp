/*
Static Object Declaration
Static objects are allocated on the stack or data segment (for global and static objects) and their lifetime is managed by the scope in which they are declared.

Characteristics:
Stack Allocation: For local variables (non-static) or directly in the data segment for global/static variables.
Lifetime: Automatic for local variables (until the end of their scope) or until the end of the program for global/static variables.
Scope: Limited to the block or file in which they are declared.

Dynamic Object Declaration
Dynamic objects are allocated on the heap using memory management operations like new (or malloc in C), and their lifetime is managed explicitly by the programmer.

Characteristics:
Heap Allocation: Memory is allocated on the heap.
Lifetime: Managed manually by the programmer. The object persists until explicitly deallocated.
Scope: Can be accessed from anywhere if you have a pointer or reference to it.
